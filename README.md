This project demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression, a foundational machine learning algorithm used for predictive modeling and data analysis. The project focuses on understanding the relationship between independent and dependent variables through data-driven insights and statistical techniques.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalizing, and visualizing datasets to prepare for analysis.
Model Development: Implementing simple and multiple linear regression models from scratch and using libraries like scikit-learn.
Performance Metrics: Evaluating model performance using metrics such as RÂ², Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Visualization: Plotting regression lines, residuals, and other trends for deeper insights.
Use Cases: Predicting real-world scenarios such as house prices, sales forecasting, or other continuous variables.

Tools and Libraries Used:
Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn

Learning Objectives:
To understand the mathematical foundation of linear regression.
To develop and interpret linear regression models.
To evaluate model performance and understand limitations like overfitting or multicollinearity.
